#Angular2, Cordova, Typescript, Webpack
##(How did frontend get so convoluted?)

This repo will hold a minimal project structure for starting a cordova application built with Angular2 in Typescript. We'll be using webpack to bundle and transpile.

TODO:
- ~~Create Example SASS output and packing~~
- Include ESLint for code style catching
- Include Cordova build scripts
- Add unit tests
